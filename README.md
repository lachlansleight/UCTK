# UCTK
If you are reading this, you've come a little bit too early!

This is a mirror of a plugin I wrote because I found myself writing the same Compute-Shader-Wrangling code again and again, and being frustrated by things like incorrect struct strides, incorrect kernal references, etc.

It's fully functional in its current state (and actively being used in basically all of my projects), but almost entirely documentation-free, and quite dependent on you writing custom scripts for it.

At some point in the next few weeks/months, I'm going to go through and change all the namespaces to UCTK, add some documentation, some more prefabs, and an example scene. I'll also make some more custom editor scripts and perhaps a custom editor window. So look forward to that!

In the meantime, if you're desperate to use this, make an issue or tweet me @LachlanSleight :)
